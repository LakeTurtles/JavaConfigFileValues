wwerwerThe Blue Black Fox Jumped Over The Fence. I can't tell you. I have never Typed from my lap. So it does feel awkward typing from the lap. But not impossible. with some practice you should be fine. Using the keyboard. I would rate this keyboard . 7/10 because it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. But if it did. I would rate it 8/10. The Keyboard is balanced aesthetics with Functionality. ssssxcccccccccccraraassdfaadas
